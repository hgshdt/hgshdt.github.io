Isn't React itself already a framework for JavaScript?\n\nWell ... first of all, React is a \"library\" for JavaScript. That seems to be important for some people.\n\nNot for me, but still, there is a valid point: React already is a framework / library for JavaScript. So it's already an extra layer on top of JS.\n\n## Why would we then need NextJS?\n\nBecause NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).\n\nIn this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:\n\n- File-based Routing\n- Built-in Page Pre-rendering\n- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities\n- Image Optimization\n- Much More\n\n## File-based Routing\n\n![Create routes via your file + folder structure](getting-started-with-nextjs/nextjs-file-based-routing.png)\n\n...

Server-side Rendering","excerpt":"","image":"","isFeatured":false,"date":"2020-01-02","tags":["Next.js","Sample"]},"content":"\nWe recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\n\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n\n- Marketing pages\n- Blog posts\n- E-commerce product listings\n- Help and documentation\n\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\n\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\n\nIn that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.\n"},{"slug":"pre-rendering","data":{"title":"Two Forms of Pre-rendering","excerpt":"","image":"","isFeatured":false,"date":"2020-01-01","tags":["Next.js","Sample"]},"content":"\nNext.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\n\n- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.\n- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
